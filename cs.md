Tom is currently studying for a PhD at the University of Bristol, supervised by [Simon McIntosh-Smith](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~simonm/), focussing on applications of [High Performance Computing](http://uob-hpc.github.io), in particular using accelerated many-core devices.

Tom is co-author of the widely used training course [Hands On OpenCL](http://handsonopencl.github.io): a two-day lecture course on OpenCL. The course material includes presentation slides and example programs, released under the Creative Commons License.

In 2012, Tom graduated valedictorian from the University of Bristol with *first class honours* with a MSci in Mathematics and Computer Science, winning the prize for *Best graduating student in Computer Science and Mathematics* sponsored by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
