Tom began playing the trumpet as a member of Harpenden Musicale, and soon joined the Luton and Bedfordshire Music Services. He attended Junior Academy at the Royal Academy of Music from the age of 14, where he took part in orchestral projects under conductors including Sir Colin Davis, and won the Dame Ruth Railton Chamber Music prize with the resident brass quintet. Tom was also a member of the National Childrens' Orchestra of Great Britain in their 25th anniversary year performing in venues including Symphony Hall, Birmingham. As a member of the National Youth Wind Ensemble, he took part in recording the Philip Grange *Clarinet Concerto* for the composer's CD.

Having completed his degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Bristol, Tom was awarded a Postgraduate Artist Diploma from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in 2014, studying both the modern and natural trumpet with Robert Farley.

Tom has played with Orchestras across the country, including Bristol Opera, Docklands Sinfonia, New Bristol Sinfonia (since 2008) and the English Schools Orchestra, as well as playing for a huge variety of amateur musical theatre productions including *Les Miserables*, *Miss Saigon*, and *My Fair Lady* to name a few. Tom has been the trumpeter for Bedford Pantomime Company's annual production since 2010. Tom also took part in The Rite of Spring Project, performing Stravinsky's work in a multi-storey car park in Peckham in 2011. As well as performing with [Ferreira Brass](http://www.ferreirabrass.com), Tom is often performing other chamber music with ensembles including Bristol Brass Consort.

Tom has performed in masterclasses for notable trumpet professors including Alastair Mackie, Paul Benniston and Tom Rainer. Tom has also had tuition from David Carstairs, international pedagog Kristian Steenstrup, Phillipe Schartz and Tim Hawes.

Tom enjoys performing contemporary music - his experience includes a performance of Stravinsky's *A Soldier's Tale* complete with dancers and he was a member of the Bristol University New Music Ensemble in 2011, performing works by Generation X composers. Equally no stranger to the brass band world, Tom has played with bands including Royal Greenwich Brass Band and Bedford Town Band.
